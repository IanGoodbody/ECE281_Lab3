More advanced elevator controller

### Pre-lab

For the pre-lab the object was to fix coding errors in the provided shell code and to create an incomplete schematic for 
the elevator control system. The main body of executable code is contained in the nexys2_sseg.vhd file. IN the files 
provided, the nexys2_sseg.vhd file is the edited file that will be implemented in later modules while the nexys2_sseg _raw
.vhd provides the origional code for comparison. The assignment also required that we draw a schematic for the nexys2_ top
_shell.vhd circuit; however, schematics for both the top module and the nexys2_sseg.vhd modle are provided here to aid in 
interpreting the changes made to the nexys2_sseg.vhd circuit.
